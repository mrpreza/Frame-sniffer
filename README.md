# Frame-sniffer
A frame sniffing project implemented on fpga


Designed and implemented a frame sniffing system on Virtex-7 VC7A35T-1FTG256C FPGA Board ,using VHDL and state machines to validate input frames received
through CAN protocol. Error detection was automated using the Scapy library and monitored via Wireshark.
