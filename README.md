### Project Description


An FPGA-based Ethernet frame sniffer designed to capture, analyze, and validate network frames at the hardware level.  
This project includes VHDL source code, a Python frame generator for testing, and a testbench for simulation.

## üöÄ Features
- **VHDL Implementation**  
  Core logic for sniffing and processing Ethernet frames on FPGA hardware.  

- **Testbench (VHDL)**  
  Simulation environment for verifying the FPGA logic.  

- **Python Frame Generator**  
  (`framegen.py`) Used to generate test frames for validation and debugging.  

- **Wireshark Integration**  
  Example captured outputs (screenshots included) for validating functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- **Hardware**:  
  - Xilinx FPGA board (or compatible)  
  - Ethernet PHY interface  

- **Software**:  
  - [Xilinx ISE / Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/) (for synthesis and simulation)  
  - Python 3.x (for frame generation)  
  - [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (for packet validation)

## ‚ö° Usage

1. **Synthesize and Deploy**  
   - Load `vhdl.vhdl` and `UCF.txt` into your FPGA project (ISE/Vivado).  
   - Compile and program the FPGA.  

2. **Run Simulation (Optional)**  
   - Open `testbench.vhdl` in your simulator.  
   - Verify output waveforms and frame detection.  

3. **Generate Test Frames**  
   ```bash
   python framegen.py
